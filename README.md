## Usage

### Adding Games
1. Use the "Add Game" tab to manually add games
2. Or use "Auto Detect" to find games from Steam/Epic
3. Set appropriate DSCP values (46 for highest priority)

### Performance Monitoring
1. Go to the "Performance" tab
2. Click "Start Performance Monitoring"
3. View real-time metrics and recommendations

### Network Diagnostics
1. Use the "Advanced Diagnostics" tab
2. Run bandwidth tests
3. Check for bufferbloat
4. Analyze connection stability

### DSCP Values Guide
- 46 (EF): Highest priority for competitive gaming
- 32 (CS4): High priority for casual gaming
- 24 (CS3): Medium priority for less demanding games

## Best Practices

### For Competitive Gaming
- Use DSCP 46 for all competitive games
- Monitor network performance regularly
- Use wired connection when possible
- Close bandwidth-intensive applications

### Network Setup
- Enable QoS on your router
- Use a gaming router with SQM if possible
- Keep network drivers updated
- Monitor for network congestion

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Application requires admin rights**
   - Run the application as administrator
   - Right-click the executable and select "Run as administrator"

2. **Games not detected**
   - Check if games are installed in default locations
   - Try manual game addition
   - Verify game executable paths

3. **Performance issues**
   - Check network diagnostics
   - Verify DSCP values
   - Monitor for network congestion
